Opening and Closing Files
Until now, you have been reading and writing to the standard input and output. Now, we will see how to use actual data
files.
Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. You can do most of the file
manipulation using a file object.

The open Function
Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built-in open() function. This function creates
 a file object, which would be utilized to call other support methods associated with it.
Syntax
File Positions
The tell() method tells you the current position within the file; in other words, the next read or write will occur at
that many bytes from the beginning of the file.

The seek(offset[, from]) method changes the current file position. The offset argument indicates the number of bytes to
be moved. The from argument specifies the reference position from where the bytes are to be moved.

If from is set to 0, it means use the beginning of the file as the reference position and 1 means use the current
position as the reference position and if it is set to 2 then the end of the file would be taken as the reference
position.
